Github wants to sign in. Click `Allow`
to open a new browser tab
    * follow the steps in the browser. Allow the page to open vscode when prompted.
    * in vscode, allow the extension to open the URI when prompted.
* type in the repository name, e.g. `enidh/robot-onboarding` and hit `Enter`

to stage all changes
* hit the `âœ“` button on top next to `Source Control` to commit your
changes. Write your commit message when prompted - make it *concise* and
*descriptive*
